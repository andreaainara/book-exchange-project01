## Existing Features:
* You can add a book through activating an exchange, and delete it if you so choose
  * Share with your friends and get exchanging
  
## Planned Features:
* This is the absolute basic version of this app, and I really want
  to include users in the future, this will make it much more interactive
* I need to fix my delete function so that it will automatically remove the data without having to refresh the page
* I would also like to make it so that you can interact and propose counter-exchanges by clicking on the open exchanges
* Having users will also allow for the ability/necessity to build user profiles
